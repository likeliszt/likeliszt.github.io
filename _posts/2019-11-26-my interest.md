**software security**

During the media content design class, I was given the task of analyzing the content market, and in doing so, I became interested in analyzing the content market.

The pictures below show the smartphone game market and Korean webtoon market.

Coding projects for college classes and assignments were the reason I entered Computer Science.

As I thought, my university worked on a number of projects, including a phone book and a video rental program.

Patents can be seen as one of the most important things in the information age. Patent attorneys with the ability to approve such patents may be one of the best jobs of the time. In order to obtain such a patent attorney, I am studying to obtain a patent attorney in Korea.

Another vision is to become a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, or CISSP, and to work as an expert in this field of security. Currently, I am studying to obtain a certificate of information security articles in Korea, and I will try to obtain a CISSP further.
